To test if a file exists you can create a function that does this for you
testfile(path) -> mode
def testfile(path): -> str
    try:
            with open(path, x):
                    return 'w'
    except:
            return 'a'

then you can do something like
with open('test', testfile('test')) as a
bam.

in the open builtin you can specify what a newline char is to ensure
compatibility with all systems.
open('file', newline='something') where 'something' is usually just ''

next builtin function can help you iterate through iterators without having to
deal with the index range. you have to convert your list, str, whatever, to an
iterator beforehand though.. using iter builtin function.
